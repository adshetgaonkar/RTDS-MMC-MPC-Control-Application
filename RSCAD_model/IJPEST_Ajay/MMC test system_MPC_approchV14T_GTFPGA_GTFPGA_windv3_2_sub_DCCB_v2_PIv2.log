WARNING-1 : VSC_Bridge 'MMC1' has a small timestep of 3695 nanoseconds.
This is greater than 3000 nanoseconds.
Small time-steps of this size and larger will
begin to significantly reduce the ratio of the
OFF impedance over the ON impedance of valves
that are represented as small inductors when ON
and small capacitors when OFF.
Such valves are NOT present in the low-loss bridges
or the chain-link convertor models.
Please watch for difficulties due to this situation
and reduce the loading on this VSC_Bridge if required.
Severity = 2,  Subsystem Number = 2 


WARNING-2 : VSC_Bridge 'MMC4' has a small timestep of 3035 nanoseconds.
This is greater than 3000 nanoseconds.
Small time-steps of this size and larger will
begin to significantly reduce the ratio of the
OFF impedance over the ON impedance of valves
that are represented as small inductors when ON
and small capacitors when OFF.
Such valves are NOT present in the low-loss bridges
or the chain-link convertor models.
Please watch for difficulties due to this situation
